== Description ==
All the credit for this plugin goes to <a href="http://blog.etiviti.com" target="_blank">Rich Fuller</a> and is entirely based on his <a href="http://blog.etiviti.com/2010/03/buddypress-hack-remove-non-friend-updates-from-the-activity-stream/">tutorial</a> for hacking BuddyPress to remove non-friend updates from the activity stream.  I simply packaged it up and made it a plugin.

The Friends Only Activity Stream plugin will limit the activity stream for general users to postings from their friends only. The admin user will see all activities, regardless of friendship. This plugin removes activity stream postings from non-friends all together with the exception of the admin and public groups.
